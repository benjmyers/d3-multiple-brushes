## D3 Multiple Brushes

This simple example, altered from Mike Bostock's "Focus+Context via Brushing" example (found at http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367), allows multiple brushes to be created, altered, and deleted. 

To start using the brush, click and drag on the chart region. 
To create new brushes, hold down your keyboard's META key and click somewhere on the chart region. Let up the META key. Your next mouse click/drag will create a new brush.
