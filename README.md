## D3 Multiple Brushes

This simple example, altered from the ["Focus+Context via Brushing" example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367), allows multiple brushes to be created, altered, and deleted. 

* To start using the brush, click and drag on the chart region. 
* To create new brushes
	* Hold down your keyboard's META key and click somewhere on the chart region
	* Let up the META key 
	* Your next mouse click/drag will create a new brush
